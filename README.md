# Earthquake-Detector-IoT-Based
This device is used to detect earthquakes with an accelerometer and gyro sensor MPU6050 and vibration sensor SW-420, where these sensors are connected to ESP32 as the microcontroller. Moreover, this device has been integrated with Firebase as the online database, using MQTT protocol to send data to a web server for data visualization. Moreover, the data sensor is also integrated with the IOS application built using Swift programming language. Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Since the visualization of the data sensor is displayed in an attractive GUI, I can ensure that the application is user-friendly.

## Required Components

- ESP32
- SW-420 Vibration Sensor
- OLED Display Module
- Active Buzzer
- MPU6050 Accelerometer and Gyroscope Module

## Project Overview

IoT Based Earthquake Detector is a device that has been integrated with a web server and mobile application as an early earthquake notification warning for the user. Moreover, the mobile application also had an additional feature, such as a daily activity planner for the user. Overall, this device involved an Accelerometer and Gyroscope Module MPU6050 to determine the center point of the device; therefore, it can quickly determine whether there is any movement from the 3-axis. In addition, the device is also equipped with a SW-420 vibration sensor to determine whether there is any vibration around the device that came from an earthquake. A buzzer is also equipped in the device, which functions as the alarm when there is vibration detected.
